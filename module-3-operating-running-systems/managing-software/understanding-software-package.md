# Understanding Software Package

* A Package is a tar ball with something in addition&#x20;
  * A script to copy files to the right location&#x20;
  * A database to keep track of what is installed&#x20;
* Packages typically focus on the software they want to install, and use dependencies for related software packages &#x20;
* That means the dependency needs to be installed before you can install the package&#x20;
* With a result that can be a real dependency hell
