# Working with History



## Understanding History

* Commands a user types are written to N/.bash\_history&#x20;
* The **history** command is used to repeat commands from this file&#x20;
* Use **history -c** to clear the current history&#x20;
* Use **history -w** to write the current history&#x20;
* Use **Ctrl-R** for reverse-i-search&#x20;
* Or use **!nn** to repeat a specific line from history
* **wc .bash\_history :** The command `wc .bash_history` is used to count the number of lines, words, and characters in the ".bash\_history" file, which typically stores a history of commands you've executed in the Bash shell
* **!i :** is used to execute the most recent command in the history that starts with the letter "i."
* **CTRL + R** : Stands as Reverse search,This feature is incredibly useful for quickly finding and re-running commands from your command history without having to scroll through it manually. It can save you time and make your command-line experience more efficient.
