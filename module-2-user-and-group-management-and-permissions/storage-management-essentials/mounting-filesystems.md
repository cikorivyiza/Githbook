# Mounting Filesystems

**`mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt`**` ``will mount the device /dev/sdb1 onto the /mnt directory`

**`umount /mnt`**` ``: unmount the filesystem associated with the /mnt directory. Make sure that you're not actively using any files or directories within that filesystem when you run this command, as unmounting will make them inaccessible until the filesystem is remounted`

**`findmnt :`**` ``command is used in Linux to display a list of currently mounted filesystems.`
